# MinecraftSessionPatcher
[THIS TOOL IS FOR PURELY EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES! I, SEAN DISHMAN, AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION TAKEN AGAINST YOU IF YOU USE THIS FOR MALICIOUS INTENT!]

Using a username, session ID, and UUID, sign into other Minecraft accounts temporarily.

```
mcsessionpatcher - Steal accounts via session token & UUID
USAGE: 
ARGS: 
nothing - Launch this application in GUI user-friendly mode, 
username session uuid (in that order) - replace using command-line. 
END
```

If you launch it without command-line arguments, it will bring up a nice universal GUI.

Why is this being released?
Too many people are elitist and are not sharing this--I want that to change. Additionally, I want Hypixel and Mojang to do something about this, instead of telling everyone to eat cake and be happy with it; until then, may chaos reign!
